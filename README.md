# Sum-of-n-Numbers

This Python program calculates the **sum of a user-defined number of values** entered one by one.

## 📌 What It Does

- Asks the user how many numbers they want to add.
- Accepts that many numbers through user input.
- Adds them together.
- Displays the total sum at the end.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter how many numbers they want to add.
2. A `while` loop runs for that count:
   - It takes an input number.
   - Adds it to a running total.
   - Decrements the counter.
3. After the loop ends, the total sum is displayed.
